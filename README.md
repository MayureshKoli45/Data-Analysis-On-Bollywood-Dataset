Data Analyst: Mayuresh Koli 

Purpose: 
In India, Bollywood is a leading film industry. Many movies are released; some have small budgets, and some have big budgets. I was wondering that movies with higher budgets are liked by audience or not. To solve this question, I am conducting this data analysis. Along with this task we might find some other interesting things.


Scope / Major Project Activities:
Activity :-                       
Data Collection -> Collection of data of Bollywood movies from 2015 to 2021.
Data Processing -> Data will be cleaned, arranged, and I will also find some important metrics to make analysis.
Analyze -> Statistically Analyze the metrics of the movies data.
Visualize -> Visualizing the movies data to find some patterns.
Concluding -> Reporting the conclusion from the analysis.

This project does not include:
1) his project will only include movies from 1st Jan 2015 to 31st Dec 2021; it does not include data before 2015 and after 2021.
2) This project only includes Bollywood movies; it does not include Telugu, Tamil or other languages movies. The movies which are made in Hindi language are considered.

Important Notes:
1) I will be using IMDB movie ratings because it is reliable and most of the Bollywood movies are listed on IMDB.
2) For budget, box office and other information I will be researching many resources and websites link will be listed.
3) There will be null values in budget and box office because lately due to pandemic many movies were released on the OTT platforms, so official budget and earnings are not revealed but 80% of movies will have those data.
4) This dataset follows official release date.
